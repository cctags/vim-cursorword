# vim-cursorword

[sherking@gmail.com](mailto:sherking@gmail.com)

This is a clone from the vim-scripts [https://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-cursorword.git](https://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-cursorword.git).

This plugin will change the background color of the word under cursor, rather than underline the word.
